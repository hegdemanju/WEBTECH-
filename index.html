                     <b>Birdie Badminton Academy was started in 2016 with aim of teaching young and aspiring badminton
                     athletes. Our main aim is to provide high quality badminton coaching to each and every player in the academy.
                     We believe that "Every Winner Was Once A Beginner". <i>Failing to plan is planning to fail</i> ; so all the coaches
                     are up to date with the training schedule for that particular day. Fitness is taken very seriously in the academy. There is fitness
                     class once a week which includes 5km running followed by an intense 20 min cardio session. Birdie has currently 162 active players
                     who work hard on their game and also thrive in academics.</b>
